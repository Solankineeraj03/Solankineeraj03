## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m Neeraj, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in **federated learning, LLMs, and cloud-native AI systems**.  
Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science at UIC (2024–2026)**, I focus on **efficient distributed learning, anomaly detection, and scalable ML pipelines**.  

I’ve shipped production-grade systems at **Deloitte USI**, led cutting-edge **research at UIC**, and contributed to projects ranging from **LLM-powered chatbots** to **streaming fraud detection engines**. My work often bridges research and deployment, making AI both **innovative and reliable**.  

Outside code and papers, I’ve captained cricket teams, competed in boxing, and won 2 national Rollball championships. 🏏🥊
