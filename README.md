## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m Neeraj, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in **federated learning, LLMs, and cloud-native AI systems**.  
Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science at UIC**, I bridge **research and real-world deployment** by building scalable, production-ready AI systems.  

I’ve shipped critical ML systems at **Deloitte**, conducted research on **communication-efficient federated learning** at **UIC**, and worked on production ML pipelines during my time at **Happiest Minds**.  

Outside work, I’m also a cricket team captain, a two-time national Rollball champion, and a state-level boxer. 🏏🥊
