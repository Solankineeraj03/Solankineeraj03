## 👨‍💻 About Me
Engineer. Researcher. Builder.  
I design and deploy **AI systems that scale**, from intelligent applications to robust ML infrastructure.  
When I’m not working on models or systems, you’ll probably find me on the cricket field or in the boxing ring — still chasing performance, just in a different arena.
